## [1.4.5] - 2025-07-21

### Improved
- **Performance Optimization**: CLI now skips translation and API calls when target files are already up to date
- **Smart Detection**: Only performs translation when there are new keys to translate
- **User Experience**: Clear messaging when translations are up to date vs when new translations are added

### Fixed
- **Unnecessary API Calls**: Prevents redundant translation requests when no new content exists
- **File Writing**: Only writes translation files when there are actual changes

## [1.4.4] - 2025-07-17

### Fixed
- **Array Structure Preservation**: Fixed critical issue where CLI command was flattening nested arrays into dot-notation keys
- **Complex JSON Support**: Arrays with nested objects (like FAQ questions) now properly maintain their structure during translation
- **CLI vs API Consistency**: CLI now uses the same translation engine as the programmatic API for consistent behavior

### Changed
- **Translation Engine**: Updated CLI to use the same TranslateAPI class for consistent structure preservation
- **Deep Merge Logic**: Improved merging of existing translations with new ones while preserving array structures
